<h4>Google Analytics</h4>
<p>
    We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use
    of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users
    visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other
    sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get
    from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects
    only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather
    than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the
    information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally
    identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent
    cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time
    you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.
    Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics
    about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms
    of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from
    recognizing you on return visits to this site by
    disabling cookies on your browser.

<h4>Children's Information</h4>
<p>
    Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using
    the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate
    in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.
</p>
<p>
    LabLineup does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information
    from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided
    this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to
    contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove
    such information from our records.

<p>
    LabLineup does not store passwords in plaintext. LabLineup will make its
    best efforts to ensure all data stored on its servers is kept secure. In
    the event of a data breach, LabLineup will notify users via email. If a
    user has deleted their account, has removed their email address, and/or
    entered an invalid or incorrect email address, LabLineup bears no 
    responsibility to contact said user. LabLineup recommends using a unique
    password for your account to migitate issues associated with a data breach.
    LabLineup accepts no responsibility for any loss or damage that may occur
    due to any release of data. By using LabLineup, you hereby consent 
    and agree to these terms.
