<h3>What is LabLineup?</h3>
<p>
    LabLineup is a web app that allows students inside of a course lab to 
    request help from the teaching assistant(s). The app will provide the
    TA(s) with a queue of students in the order in which they submitted
    requests for help. The functionality can be expanded to include reports
    and notifications for the instructor of record. The instructor will be 
    able to see short descriptions of problems, which will allow him/her to
    see common issues between students. After the student receives help, he/she
    can rate the TA’s assistance (feedback will be submitted to the 
    instructor). If the number of requests in the queue reaches a threshold, 
    the professor can receive a notification telling him/her that more 
    assistance is needed in the lab. The web app can display the student’s
    current position in the queue along with an estimated wait time.

<h3>Who made it?</h3>
<p>
    LabLineup was created by five students at the University of South Carolina
    as part of the Computer Science/Computer Engineering curriculum. We
    appreciate your support and would encourage you to purchase a premium
    subscription.
